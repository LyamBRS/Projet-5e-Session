\item\contentsline{section}{Librairies/\+Communications/\mbox{\hyperlink{_service_communication_8c}{Service\+Communication.\+c}} \\*Program file containing the code defined in \mbox{\hyperlink{_service_communication_8h}{Service\+Communication.\+h}} Please refer to this other file for information necessary in order to make this work }{\pageref{_service_communication_8c}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{Librairies/\+Communications/\mbox{\hyperlink{_service_communication_8h}{Service\+Communication.\+h}} \\*This service is a c library which goal is to parse data sent or data received for a school project. This file requires premade functions and buffers which are labeled and described in this document in order to work properly or at all. This service\textquotesingle{}s goal is to allow the user to solely use structures in order to check for received info or send info. The communication protocol range from UART to CAN. However, you will need ot parse UART data a bit more }{\pageref{_service_communication_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{Librairies/\+Communications/\mbox{\hyperlink{_service_communication___t_e_s_t_8c}{Service\+Communication\+\_\+\+TEST.\+c}} \\*This file\textquotesingle{}s only purpose is to test the compilation and executions of the multiple functions present in \mbox{\hyperlink{_service_communication_8c}{Service\+Communication.\+c}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{_service_communication_8h}{Service\+Communication.\+h}} This file contains a main function to serve as execution }{\pageref{_service_communication___t_e_s_t_8c}}{}
