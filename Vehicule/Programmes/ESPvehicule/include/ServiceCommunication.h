 * This service is a c library which goal is to parse data sent or data received for a school project.
 * This file requires premade functions and buffers which are labeled and described in this document in order to work properly or at all.
 * This service's goal is to allow the user to solely use structures in order to check for received info or send info.
 * The communication protocol range from UART to CAN. However, you will need ot parse UART data a bit more.
